In this exercise We have to find the coordinates of where a photo was taken.

Exercise level:
For beginners: Hard
For experts: Medium

Clue number 1 - The picture
<img src="https://gralhix.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/osintexercise001.png" alt="picture of Kiffa"></img>

In the picture we can see that it has a lot of dirt and a paved road, probably a main road deal. We can see that there are a couple of buildings, however the greenery is what is telling the most.
There is a wall on the right side that has bricks and white stuff. To the left you see a couple of arches.
Next to the road we can also see the powercables that are going with the road, so it's going somewhere important.

When we look back to the text we can see that the person talks about Kiffa, a quick google maps search gives us an African town which definitely suits the picture.
The timestamp is 1:45PM, so with the shadows going to the right we could conclude that we are looking north. HOWEVER! This is actually overlooking to the south,
in the text the person says "This morning", so we can conclude that we are looking to the south.

While looking on Google Maps, we can see a main road to the south, there is no streetview available, so let's do some detective work from the top.
The text says something about newcomers, so this must be a tourist, even though it's translated from Arabic, newcomers is an important term.
To the south is Kiffa Airport, which would mean that this picture could have been taken close to the airport.
Where do tourists normally stay? In an hotel. In the south we have L'hotel de kiffa Maurianie.

Important in the hotels name is the language used, it's French, a lot of African countries were either colonized by the French or Belgian.
Knowing a bit about Africa and it's history, a lot of countries had French as it's official language and speak Arabic as a second, especialy in northern Africa.
This could be a tourist from one of the northern African countries, namely Marocco, Libie or Tunisia. The only reason why I think of it, is to confirm that this could be a tourist,
staying at a hotel.

The hotel has a lot of plants to the south as well, it looks like it could be a river, there aren't many other places than next to the hotel where this picture could have been taken.
So going with this, this would be the coordinates of: 16.609540454612713, -11.397876961517916

Until this part I have not used any write ups and have only used Google Maps.
Checking two write ups who have individualy checked the video of a walkthrough given by the creator, they both agree, in combination of the video, that this is the exact place!
