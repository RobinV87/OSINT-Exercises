<p>In the picture we can see that it has a lot of dirt and a paved road, probably a main road deal. We can see that there are a couple of buildings, however the greenery is what is telling the most.
\n There is a wall on the right side that has bricks and white stuff. To the left you see a couple of arches.
Next to the road \n
We can also see the powercables that are going with the road, so it's going somewhere important. \n</p>
